**Here's how you can use screen in Linux:**

**1. Create a screen session:**

```
screen -S session_name
```

- Replace "session_name" with your desired session name.


**2. Attach to an existing session:**

```
screen -r session_name
```

**3. Create a new window within the session:**

```
Ctrl + c  # Create a new window
Ctrl + a c  # Name the window
```

**4. Switch between windows:**

```
Ctrl + a n  # Switch to the next window
Ctrl + a p  # Switch to the previous window
```

**5. Resize the window:**

```
Ctrl + a +  # Increase window size
Ctrl + a -  # Decrease window size
```

**6. Quit the screen session:**

```
Ctrl + a d  # Disconnect from the session
```

**7. Reattach to the session later:**

```
screen -r -S session_name
```

**Additional tips:**

- Use `screen -list` to list all your current screen sessions.
- Use `screen -ls` to list all your past screen sessions.
- Press `Ctrl + a ?` to see a list of all keyboard shortcuts for screen.

**Common screen commands:**

- `screen -h`: Get screen help.
- `screen -l`: Launch screen in a login window.
- `screen -multi`: Create multiple windows in a single session.
- `screen -p`: Start screen in the background.

**Note:**

- Screen is a terminal multiplexer, which means it allows you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously in a single terminal window.
- It's especially useful for long-running processes or when you need to detach from a terminal session and continue working later.
